# sbp-snn

### main
main_snn_desktop, the basic SNN model for three tasks, for single trial experiment.
main_snn_server, the parpool versions of SNN model, for large scale experiments.

### snn
Architecture of SNN model.

### demos
Simple demo of LIF neuron and STP, other more demos will be released further.

### dvsgesture
The preprocessing code for dvsgesture before SNN classification.

### data
The source data of three tasks.

### figures
Plot spike trains at beginning and end of training.

### logs
Saved logs including configurations and performance.

### showimgs
Saved Dvsgesture image after normalization and conversion.

### tempralfeatures
Tools for converting raw sequential information to features.

### trained_nn
Some saved snn, some models are old, you'd better retrain by your self.

### tsne
t-sne code for visualization of neuron states.
